    "\n",
    "I attempted to execute the code, but encountered an issue as my environment does not have internet access to retrieve the file directly from the URL. This caused the code to fail with a connection error.\n",
    "3. Alternative Suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggested that you could:\n",
    "Download the CSV file yourself and upload it to me, so I could process it in this environment.\n",
    "Run the code on your local machine where internet access is available.\n",
    "4. Follow-up Attempt:\n",
    "\n",
    "You repeated your original request, and I reiterated the same explanation: I cannot access external URLs due to current system limitations. I again offered the alternative option to upload the dataset or to run the code on your local setup.\n",
