    "\n",
    "Are there significant differences between men and women in their preferences on time for social interaction across various groups of people, such as friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the research question, the key variables required are: gender of the surveyeds and their preference time with different groups (friends, fanmily, colleagues, and neighbors).\n",
    "Genders are the comparison groups that would be compared and preference time with different groups would show the differences between genders. Together, these variables would explore how gender may influence social preferences. \n",
    "The data would be shown in bar graph which the preference groups are on the x-axis and the average time spend are on the y-axis. Each gender would have different colors and showed their average time spending on different groups. \n",
    "Bar graph is the most appropriate type of visualization because it could easily showed the differences of the average time spending with differenet groups based on the genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis test would be used to answer the question. First, stated that Null Hypothesis (H0) is \"There are no significant differences in social interaction times between women and men.\" and the Alternative Hypothesis (H1) is :\"There are significant differences in social interaction times between women and men.\". \n",
    "Then, calculated the average time spend with each group for both women and men and compared each social groups. Calculated and determined the p-values for each social group for both women and men. If p < 0.05 , reject the null hypothesis, in another word, there is a significant difference. \n",
    "Last, compared the differences in time used between women and men, and the p-value for that. The differences and weither it is significant or not would be shown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There are no significant differences in social interactiom times beween women and men\" as if non of the p-values showed p < 0.05. This hypothesis answered the research question that \"Are there significant differences between men and women in their preferences on time for social interaction across various groups of people, such as friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors?\" and the answer is NO. \n",
    "If there is one or more p-values that is smaller than 0.05, therefore, there is a significant difference between women and men in their preferences on time for social interaction with friends/family/colleagues/neighbors/all. It answered a part of the question by YES or it is a fully YES. "

First, organized the data for age into categories.Then, ramdonly sample from the dataset with replacement to creates bootstrap sample. Repeat this process a large number of times. Calculate the statistic intervals for each Bootstap sample. \n",

    "The average age of partcipants taking the survey is, for example, 50 years old and how the age distributed across different age groups could been seen by the histogram graph. This answered the question and the number of the average age would be replace after the real processes were done. "
