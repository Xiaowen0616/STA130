I explained how to simulate a p-value using a \"50/50 coin-flipping\" model and a binomial distribution, assuming no inherent head-tilting preference. We calculated both an approximate and exact p-value, determining strong evidence against the null hypothesis (indicating a tendency for right tilt).\n",

    "The z-score was found to be 2.012, and the p-value was 0.044, suggesting that the proportion of students who identified the correct order of pouring (milk or tea) was statistically significantly different from 0.5. Thus, we concluded that students could discern the order of pouring better than random guessing.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the p-value being less than 0.05, the null hypothesis was rejected.
